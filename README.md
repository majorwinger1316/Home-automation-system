# Home-automation-system
This repository includes code and circuit of an ir based home automation system. The IRrecvDemo.ino file includes the demo file which is included in the ir library. connect the arduino or any esp to your laptop and connect an ir sensor to your esp/arduino. upload the IRrecvDemo.ino file to your arduino/esp. point your working remote to ir sensor and note down the hexa decimal codes of each button. Now write down the sketch_mar27b.ino code in your arduino ide and write down the respective hexa decimal codes in the code and feed it into the arduino. connect a 4 module relay to your aduino and test the code. connect the whole circuit to your house wiring and now you have a room with ir controlled appliances.
